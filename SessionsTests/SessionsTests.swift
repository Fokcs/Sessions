/// Placeholder test structure using Swift Testing framework
/// 
/// **Current State:** Contains only example placeholder test
/// 
/// **Future Development:**
/// This test structure is prepared for Swift Testing framework adoption.
/// As the app develops beyond Stage 1, additional test suites can be added here
/// to complement the existing XCTest-based FoundationTests.
/// 
/// **Swift Testing vs XCTest:**
/// - Swift Testing provides more modern syntax with @Test attribute
/// - Better integration with async/await patterns
/// - FoundationTests.swift contains the comprehensive test coverage for Stage 1
/// - This file is ready for future test expansion using Swift Testing patterns
/// 
/// **Recommendation:**
/// For immediate development, focus on expanding FoundationTests.swift
/// which already contains comprehensive coverage of the repository layer.
struct SessionsTests {

    /// Example test demonstrating Swift Testing framework usage
    /// 
    /// **TODO:** Replace with actual test implementations as features are developed
    /// **Framework:** Uses Swift Testing's @Test attribute and #expect syntax
    @Test func example() async throws {
        // Write your test here and use APIs like `#expect(...)` to check expected conditions.
        // This placeholder should be replaced with actual test logic
    }
