/// Main content view for the Sessions watchOS application
/// 
/// **Current State:** Placeholder implementation with basic "Hello, world!" content
/// 
/// **Future watchOS-Specific Implementation (Stage 2+):**
/// This view will serve as the primary interface for watchOS therapy logging, featuring:
/// - Quick session start/stop controls with large, accessible buttons
/// - Real-time session timer and progress indicators
/// - Simplified goal logging interface optimized for glanceable interactions
/// - Integration with Digital Crown for rapid cue level selection
/// - Haptic feedback for confirmation of logged actions
/// 
/// **watchOS Design Principles:**
/// - Large touch targets for easy interaction during therapy sessions
/// - High contrast colors and clear typography for quick recognition
/// - Minimal navigation depth to reduce interaction complexity
/// - Support for both tap and Digital Crown input methods
/// - Integration with watchOS complications for quick access
/// 
/// **Platform Integration:**
/// - Designed to work seamlessly alongside iOS app
/// - Optimized for therapist's non-dominant hand usage
/// - Quick access to most frequently used therapy logging functions
